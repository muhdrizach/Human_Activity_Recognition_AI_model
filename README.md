# Human_Activity_Recognition_AI_model

Built a machine learning model using TimeDistributed CNNs and LSTMs to classify video-based activities such as golf and
bike riding with high accuracy.
• Designed a pipeline for frame extraction, resizing, normalization, and temporal sequence handling to preprocess video
data effectively for model training.
• Utilized Google Drive for dataset storage and implemented a video prediction system capable of identifying activities from
user-uploaded videos.
